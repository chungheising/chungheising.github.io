### Abstract

Renewable energy infrastructure has evolved from a policy-supported niche into a core institutional asset class attracting long-duration capital from pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and development finance institutions. Despite this shift, prevailing analytical frameworks continue to treat renewable energy primarily through the lenses of project finance or climate policy, underestimating the governance and fiduciary challenges that dominate long-term ownership outcomes. This paper reframes renewable energy as a governance-intensive institutional asset class defined by three interrelated dimensions: capital structure complexity, exposure to policy risk, and long-duration governance requirements. It argues that failures in governance design and policy-risk management—rather than technology risk or market price volatility—are the primary drivers of underperformance in renewable infrastructure portfolios. This perspective has direct implications for institutional asset allocation, public policy design, and the sequencing of financial innovation, including emerging interest in tokenized real-world assets.

### Key Implications
- Renewable energy investment outcomes are governed more by long-duration governance quality than by technology performance or short-term price dynamics.
- Capital structure design embeds control rights and fiduciary outcomes that persist across asset lifecycles.
- Policy risk functions as a structural financial variable that cannot be fully mitigated through pricing or diversification alone.
- Financial innovation in real assets succeeds only when governance maturity precedes abstraction and increased tradability.
