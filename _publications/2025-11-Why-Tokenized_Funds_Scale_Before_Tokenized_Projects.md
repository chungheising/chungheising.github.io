**Working Paper, November 2025**

This paper argues that **tokenized funds will reach institutional scale before tokenized projects**, not because projects are less “real” or less investable, but because **fund wrappers fit existing institutional workflows**—including compliance, custody, fiduciary oversight, reporting, diversification, and distribution. In contrast, project-level tokenization often collides with off-chain constraints such as permitting risk, operational governance, cashflow verification, and fragmented legal enforcement.

The paper frames the adoption path as a sequencing problem: institutions will start where **risk ownership, governance, and distribution** can be standardized. Funds provide a familiar vehicle for **aggregation and delegated decision-making**, allowing tokenization to improve settlement, transferability, and investor onboarding without requiring every underlying asset to be “fully on-chain.”

Implications are drawn for:
- **Fund managers** designing tokenized vehicles (governance, disclosures, transfer controls)
- **Platforms** building institutional-grade distribution rails (whitelisting, compliance automation, reporting)
- **Regulators** evaluating tokenized structures (equivalence to existing fund regimes, investor protection)
- **Institutional allocators** assessing operational risk and governance fit across wrappers
