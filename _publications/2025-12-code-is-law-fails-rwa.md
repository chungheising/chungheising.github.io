### Abstract
The proposition that “code is law” has been central to the development of blockchain-based markets, promising automated enforcement, reduced transaction costs, and trustless coordination. While this paradigm has shown partial success in digital-native environments, its application to real-world assets (RWAs) has proven far more problematic. Despite increasing experimentation with tokenization, institutional adoption remains limited.
This paper argues that the primary barrier is not technological maturity, but a structural mismatch between on-chain execution and off-chain governance, legal authority, and fiduciary responsibility. Real-world assets embed discretion, enforceability, and institutional accountability that cannot be fully specified ex ante in code. Approaching the problem from an institutional adoption perspective, the paper reframes tokenization as an institutional design challenge rather than a software problem, with implications for policymakers, regulators, and institutional investors.
