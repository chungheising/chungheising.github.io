**Working Paper, December 2025**

This paper examines why the principle of “code is law,” while effective in digital-native environments, fails when applied to real-world assets. It argues that the primary barrier to institutional adoption of tokenized RWAs is not technological maturity, but a structural mismatch between on-chain execution and off-chain governance, legal authority, and fiduciary responsibility. The paper reframes tokenization as an institutional design challenge rather than a software problem, with implications for policymakers, regulators, and institutional investors.
