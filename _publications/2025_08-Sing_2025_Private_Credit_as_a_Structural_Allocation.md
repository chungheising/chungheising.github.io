### Abstract
Private credit is often explained as the byproduct of post–global financial crisis bank retrenchment. That account is incomplete. If the asset class were merely a cyclical substitute for bank lending, institutional allocations would have normalized as conditions changed. Instead, capital has deepened its exposure across market environments. This paper argues that private credit has become a structural allocation because it has transitioned from episodic deployment into permanent capital—supported by durable manager platforms, repeat deployment expectations, and ongoing borrower and sponsor relationships.

As private credit becomes permanent, performance depends less on opportunistic entry points and more on governance practices that can be sustained across cycles. The institutionalization of the asset class shifts the primary source of advantage from market timing to organizational capability: underwriting discipline, portfolio construction, workout capacity, valuation and reporting controls, conflicts management, and LP oversight mechanisms. The paper outlines the implications for allocators, managers, and governance bodies—especially where private credit sits inside multi-asset portfolios alongside public credit and private equity.

### Key points
- Private credit persists because it has become permanent capital, not a temporary dislocation trade.
- Institutional outcomes are increasingly determined by governance and operating controls, not category labels.
- LP oversight, transparency, and conflicts management become central as strategies scale.
