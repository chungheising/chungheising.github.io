## Abstract

Organizations commonly treat strategy as the primary driver of outcomes and capital allocation as a downstream implementation detail. In practice, the reverse is true. Capital allocation determines which strategies survive, which remain theoretical, and which quietly fail.

This paper argues that capital allocation is not a managerial or technical function, but a core governance responsibility. Boards and institutional owners shape outcomes not through strategic endorsement, but through the constraints, pacing, and irreversibility of capital commitment.
