### Abstract

Renewable energy infrastructure has undergone a structural transformation in how it is financed, owned, and governed. Once viewed primarily as a policy instrument or a high-risk technology investment, renewable energy assets—particularly utility-scale solar and wind—are now increasingly treated as long-duration infrastructure investments suitable for institutional portfolios. This paper argues that renewable energy should be analyzed explicitly as a governance-intensive institutional asset class characterized by complex capital structures, significant policy risk, and long-duration fiduciary challenges. Reframing renewable energy in this way clarifies the dominant drivers of long-run outcomes and highlights the limits of financial innovation efforts that prioritize liquidity over governance.
