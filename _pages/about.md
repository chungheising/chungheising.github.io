I work at the intersection of **institutional capital allocation**, **governance**, and **financial infrastructure**, with a particular focus on **real-world assets**, **infrastructure and energy finance**, and **long-term investment decision-making**.

My background spans institutional investing, board and fiduciary governance, and applied research across public and private markets, including infrastructure, energy, venture capital, and emerging digital financial systems.

## What I do

- **Research:** applied frameworks and implementation notes on institutional investing, governance, and real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure  
- **Advisory:** selective work with funds, founders, and institutions on strategy, governance, and readiness for institutional capital  
- **Speaking & teaching:** invited talks and academic or professional teaching engagements on finance, governance, and innovation  

## Current research direction

My current research agenda focuses on:

1) **RWA tokenization & digital market infrastructure**  
   (governance, trust, verification, and institutional implementation)

2) **Infrastructure & energy finance**  
   (risk allocation, capital structuring, and long-horizon deployment)

3) **Fiduciary governance and decision systems**  
   (boards, investment committees, and institutional design)

## Background and perspective

I have advised and worked with asset owners, investment platforms, startups, and public-interest organizations on questions of how capital is structured, governed, and deployed under regulatory, operational, and geopolitical constraints.

In recent years, my work has increasingly focused on **tokenization and digital infrastructure for real-world assets**, examining how new technologies interact with established legal, governance, and fiduciary frameworks. Rather than treating tokenization as a purely technical innovation, my research emphasizes institutional adoption, governance design, and practical implementation—**what actually works, what fails, and why**.

I publish applied research and frameworks intended for **institutional investors, policymakers, boards, and founders**, rather than retail audiences. My work is designed to inform decision-making in complex organizations where capital allocation choices have durable, long-term consequences.

## Research interests

- Long-term asset allocation and portfolio construction  
- Infrastructure and energy finance  
- Governance and fiduciary design  
- Tokenization and digital market infrastructure  
- Board-level decision-making in complex organizations  

I hold affiliations with academic, investment, and public-interest institutions, and I engage selectively in **advisory and board roles** where my experience and research can add durable value.
