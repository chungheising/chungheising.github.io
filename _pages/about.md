I work at the intersection of **institutional capital allocation**, **governance**, and **emerging financial infrastructure**, with a particular focus on **real-world assets**, **infrastructure/energy finance**, and **long-term investment decision-making**.

My work spans institutional investing and governance roles across multiple asset classes and operating contexts, including endowment-style portfolio construction, venture/growth investing, public-purpose investment governance, and renewable infrastructure development.

## What I do

- **Research:** applied frameworks and implementation notes on institutional investing, governance, and RWA infrastructure  
- **Advisory:** selective work with funds, founders, and institutions on strategy, governance, and readiness for institutional capital  
- **Speaking/teaching:** invited talks and academic/professional teaching engagements on finance, governance, and innovation

## Current research direction

My current research agenda focuses on:

1) **RWA tokenization & digital market infrastructure** (governance, trust, verification, and institutional implementation)  
2) **Infrastructure & energy finance** (risk allocation and long-horizon deployment)  
3) **Fiduciary governance and decision systems** (boards, ICs, and institutional design)

For a structured overview of my work, see **Research & Publications**.
