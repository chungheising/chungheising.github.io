I engage selectively in advisory and board-related work where governance and capital allocation decisions have durable consequences.

## Focus areas

- **Board / Investment Committee support:** decision frameworks, governance, risk oversight  
- **RWA / tokenization advisory:** institutional readiness, governance design, implementation strategy  
- **Infrastructure & energy finance:** structuring, risk allocation, long-horizon capital deployment  
- **Startup / fund advisory:** strategy, fundraising positioning, governance and credibility with institutional stakeholders

## Engagement style

- Discrete projects or retained advisory (selectively)  
- Clear deliverables, confidentiality, and pragmatic implementation focus
