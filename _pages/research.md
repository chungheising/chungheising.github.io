## Active Research Projects

## Governance, AI, and Institutional Adoption in Infrastructure Finance

I am currently developing a research project that examines how governance design, AI-assisted verification, and digital asset structures can reduce information asymmetry and support institutional adoption in cross-border renewable infrastructure finance.

The work focuses on large-scale infrastructure assets such as solar, wind, and energy storage projects, where long investment horizons, regulatory complexity, and cross-border operational risk often limit institutional participation despite attractive fundamentals.

### Core research questions
- How do governance and verification constraints shape institutional investment decisions in infrastructure and climate finance?
- How can AI-assisted monitoring and data validation improve transparency and risk management without increasing operational complexity?
- Under what conditions do digital and tokenized asset structures enhance, rather than undermine, institutional trust and adoption?

### Research contributions
- A governance-first framework for evaluating AI and digital asset applications in infrastructure finance  
- An applied analysis of institutional adoption barriers across policy, regulatory, and organizational dimensions  
- Design principles for aligning AI-enabled verification systems with fiduciary and supervisory requirements  

This project is being developed as a working paper and is intended to form the foundation for doctoral research in AI governance, digital asset regulation, and sustainable finance.
