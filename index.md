# Applied research on institutional investing, governance, and real-world asset infrastructure.

I work at the intersection of **capital allocation**, **fiduciary governance**, and **emerging financial infrastructure**, with a particular focus on **real-world assets (RWA)**, **infrastructure/energy finance**, and **long-horizon investment decision-making**.

This site is an academic-style archive of **frameworks, implementation notes, and selected talks** intended for institutional investors, policymakers, boards, and research collaborators.

---

## Current focus

- **Tokenization & RWA market infrastructure:** governance, legal/operational design, and institutional implementation
- **Infrastructure & energy finance:** cash flows, risk allocation, and long-term capital deployment
- **Institutional decision-making:** boards, fiduciary design, and governance quality as a driver of outcomes

## Selected writing (start here)

- [The RWA Tokenization Stack: From Assets to Investors](/publications/)
- [Renewable Energy as an Asset Class: Cash Flows, Risk, and Governance](/publications/)
- [Capital Allocation as a Board Responsibility, Not a Management Detail](/publications/)
- [Private Credit as a Structural Allocation: Where It Fits and Where It Breaks](/publications/)

> Tip: I publish in “research note” format—concise, structured, and designed to be useful in real decision contexts.

## Collaboration and advisory

I engage selectively on:
- **RWA/tokenization strategy and institutional readiness**
- **infrastructure / energy finance governance and structuring**
- **board / investment committee decision frameworks**
- **startup / fund strategy at the intersection of finance and infrastructure**

If you’d like to discuss research collaboration or advisory work, the fastest way to reach me is via LinkedIn (sidebar).
